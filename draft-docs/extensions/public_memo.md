This spec is a suggestion for a future improvement.  It has not yet
been implemented and is not yet considered normative for wallets.

public_memo_data specification
------------------------------

The `public_memo_data` is a `data_extension` which suggests to wallets
to display some text.

- All wallets should support displaying and sending memos with accounts'
memo keys for `asset_issue_operation`, `transfer_operation`,
`override_transfer_operation` and `withdraw_permission_claim_operation`.
